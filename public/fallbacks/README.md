# Fallback Images

This directory contains premium SVG fallback images generated to match the website's Forest/Sage/Lime color palette.

## Files

- **fallback-code.svg**: A stylized code editor interface. Ideal for coding projects.
- **fallback-server.svg**: A server rack visualization. Great for backend/infrastructure projects.
- **fallback-dashboard.svg**: A minimal analytics dashboard. Perfect for SaaS/Web App projects.
- **fallback-mobile.svg**: A mobile app interface mockup. Best for mobile/PWA projects.
- **fallback-workflow.svg**: A node-based workflow visualization. Ideal for automation/API projects.

## Usage

You can use these images anywhere in the application by referencing their path:

```tsx
<Image src="/fallbacks/fallback-code.svg" alt="Placeholder" ... />
```

These are vector graphics (SVG), so they are lightweight and scale infinitely without losing quality.
