I turned ₹0 ad spend into ₹3,00,000+ revenue.

I built an organic lead gen machine for an aviation institute that was bleeding ₹50k/month on ads.

50+ leads. 12% conversion rate.

The client was stuck in an "Ad Trap."

Paying ₹800 per lead.
Spending 4 hours/day on manual WhatsApp admin.
Zero organic presence.

They asked: "Can we stop depending on paid ads?"

I said yes.

• Firebase + Airtable CRM

Infrastructure cost: Literally zero.

Automation is useless if it's flaky.

I fixed an n8n "empty object" bug that killed 40% of bookings.

Built 3-layer validation + non-blocking webhooks.

Reliability: 99.7%.
Response time: 6 hours → 2 minutes.

Performance is a feature.

I pushed Lighthouse from <50 to 95+.

Result: 20+ keywords on Page 1 of Google.
19,300 impressions in 6 months.

Speed drives rankings. Rankings drive revenue.
