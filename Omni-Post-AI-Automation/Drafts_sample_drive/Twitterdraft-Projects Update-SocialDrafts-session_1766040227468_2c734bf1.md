Tweet 1/5

I spent 4 weeks building an automation engine that handles my entire content strategy.

I'm saving 3.75 hours every week. No more manual churn.

Manual content workflows are the silent killer of deep work.

Most devs waste hours copy-pasting from Notion to Twitter. I was losing nearly 4 hours a week just trying to stay consistent.

The stack: n8n + Notion API + Gemini 2.5 Flash.

I ditched Gemini Pro to keep API costs at zero. Flash handles extraction, strategy, and generation without breaking a sweat.

The engine extracts raw notes, checks trends via Perplexity, and schedules to Twitter/LinkedIn.

Result? 100% consistency and zero manual effort. Automation always beats willpower.
