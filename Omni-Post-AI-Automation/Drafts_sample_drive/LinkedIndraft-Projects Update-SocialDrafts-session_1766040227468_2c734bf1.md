I cut my weekly content overhead by 100% using a custom AI automation engine.

Manual content distribution is a developer's productivity killer. I was losing nearly 4 hours every week copy-pasting notes from Notion, formatting them for LinkedIn, and trying to keep a consistent schedule while building client projects.

I decided to solve this like an engineer, not a social media manager.

Over the last 4 weeks, I built 'Omni-Post'—a full-stack automation system that turns my raw engineering notes into a multi-platform content strategy.


1. Content Extraction: I used the Notion API to monitor a specific 'Ready to Post' database. The moment I drop a technical note, the engine triggers.
2. The Strategy Engine: I initially integrated Gemini 2.5 Pro, but the cost-to-performance ratio for high-volume tasks didn't make sense. I pivoted to Gemini 2.5 Flash. It’s faster, significantly cheaper, and handles the strategic analysis perfectly when fed with specific prompts.
3. Real-time Research: I integrated Perplexity's API to perform trend analysis on the fly, ensuring the content isn't just a summary but remains relevant to current industry shifts.
4. Multi-Platform Publishing: Using N8N, I built logic gates to format content differently for X (threads) and LinkedIn (long-form case studies), then pushed them via their respective APIs.


Results:
- Reclaimed 2.5 - 3.75 hours every single week.
- Established a defined, unbreakable posting schedule.
- Integrated Airtable to track performance metrics automatically.
- Reduced AI API costs significantly by optimizing model selection (Pro vs Flash).

High-agency development isn't just about the code you write for clients; it's about the systems you build to optimize your own output.

If you're still manually managing your distribution, you’re leaving engineering hours on the table.

How are you using automation to protect your deep-work time?
