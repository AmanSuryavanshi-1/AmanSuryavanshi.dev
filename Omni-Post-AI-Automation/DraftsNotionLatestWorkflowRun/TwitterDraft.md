I killed the ads and built an automated system that handles the grunt work.

The stack: Next.js 14 + n8n.

I used a non-blocking webhook architecture so form submissions never fail, even if the backend is down.

3 workflows pipe leads into Airtable.

Total infrastructure cost? ₹0/month.

I fixed a critical n8n bug where 40% of booking data arrived empty.

Built a 3-layer validation system that pushed reliability to 99.7%.

If your automation fails, your brand fails.
