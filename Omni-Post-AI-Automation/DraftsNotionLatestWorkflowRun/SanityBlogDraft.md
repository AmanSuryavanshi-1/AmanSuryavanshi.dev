# How I Replaced ₹50k/Month Ad Spend with an Automated Next.js Machine (₹3 Lakh Case Study)

**TL;DR:** I transitioned a DGCA ground school from a ₹50,000/month ad dependency to a ₹0/month organic lead machine. By combining Next.js 14, n8n automation, and a zero-cost infrastructure stack, we generated ₹3,00,000+ in revenue with a 95+ Lighthouse score and 85% less admin work.

### Prerequisites
To get the most out of this deep dive, you should have a baseline understanding of:
* **Next.js 14 (App Router):** Server components and API routes.
* **Automation Logic:** Basic familiarity with webhooks and nodes (n8n/Zapier).
* **Headless CMS/DB:** Conceptual knowledge of Sanity.io and Firebase.
